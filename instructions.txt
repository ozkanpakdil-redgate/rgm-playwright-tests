1. Navigate to https://monitor.red-gate.com/
1.1 check already written tests and exclude those scenarios
2. Browse through everywhere and all links
3. Test all functionality, like filtering sorting and anything you can find
4. First finish all testing after that make sure these tests have performance column, meaning every page or functionalty will have performance metrics and record them and prepare a full report.
5. in the future I want to alarm if any feature/functionality get slower I want to be warned and reported.
- write these in node project, this project has the latest playwright already do not need to update package json for that
