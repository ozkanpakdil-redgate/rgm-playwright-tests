## üìà Setting Up GitHub Pages (Optional)

To deploy HTML reports to GitHub Pages:

1. Uncomment the GitHub Pages deployment steps in `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. HTML reports will be available at: `https://[username].github.io/[repository]/performance-report.html`

## üöÄ GitHub Actions Outputs

The workflow sets these outputs for use in other jobs:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run tests
    id: playwright-tests
    # ... test steps ...
    
  - name: Use test results
    run: |
      echo "Tests passed: ${{ steps.playwright-tests.outputs.tests-passed }}"
      echo "Tests failed: ${{ steps.playwright-tests.outputs.tests-failed }}"
      echo "Success rate: ${{ steps.playwright-tests.outputs.success-rate }}%"
```

Available outputs:
- `tests-passed` - Number of passed tests
- `tests-failed` - Number of failed tests  
- `tests-total` - Total number of tests
- `duration` - Total test duration in ms
- `success-rate` - Success percentage
